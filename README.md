# plsql-collections-records-goto# PL/SQL Collections, Records, and GOTO — Repository

## Overview
This repository demonstrates how to use key PL/SQL composite data types and control statements, including:
- **Associative Arrays (index-by tables)**
- **VARRAYs (fixed-size ordered arrays)**
- **Nested Tables (dynamic, can become sparse)**
- **Records** — table-based (%ROWTYPE), user-defined, and cursor-based records
- **GOTO statements** — a short, documented example (for learning only)

These examples follow the concepts taught in Lecture 06: *PL/SQL Collections and Records.*
